- Very good in 1-2 others
- Major cloud providers
- Cloud-agnostic open source tools
- Build and deploy a production-grade web/mobile app from scratch

### Certifications

Certifications are useful to provide a path for learning a new tech stack and to demonstrate baseline knowledge to clients. Some certs that are useful:
- AWS/GCP/Azure Cloud Architect
- AWS/GCP/Azure Security Professional
- Kubernetes Admin

## Learning Path

### 1 - Core C#

These are essential for writing good quality software. Many of the philosophies and techniques can be applied outside of C# development to write good code in other languages and frameworks. After knowing this content, a developer is ready to be a productive consultant.

### 2 - Cloud Intro

Learn the basics of the cloud and what's available.

- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

### 3 - DevOps Intro

The gist of what we do in DevOps is Linux + Docker + GitHub Actions. Sometimes we use different tools than GH, but knowing the command line, Linux, and Docker are always used.

- Linux Fundamentals: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/linux-fundamentals-1
- Docker Fundamentals: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/docker-fundamentals-for-developers

- Bash: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/shell-scripting-with-bash-and-z-shell

### 4 - Initial Certifications

By this stage, the consultant should be knowledgeable enough to begin preparing for and passing certifications to demonstrate expertise at the associate level.

- AWS Certified Developer - Associate
- Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)
- LPI Linux Essentials (010-160)

### 5 - Web

Though the majority of our work is likely to be backend / .NET, we should be well-versed in web development, as well. At least as far as being able to efficiently build and maintain clean web applications. We may not be experts in this area, but we should be highly competent.

- JavaScript: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/javascript-core-language
- TypeScript: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/typescript-core-language
- React: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/building-web-applications-with-react
- Vue: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/building-web-apps-with-vue
- Bootstrap: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/styling-the-web-with-bootstrap
- Tailwind: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/tailwind-css-3-fundamentals

### 6 - Advanced Architecture

Now we're ready to dive deeper into architecture. This stage has a mix of certifications (with learning involved) and concepts, particularly microservices and DDD.

- Microservices Architecture: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/microservices-architecture
- Architecting in AWS: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/architecting-in-aws
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate
- Domain Driven Design: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/domain-driven-design

### 7 - Advanced DevOps

Finally, we're ready to dig deeper into the world of DevOps. IaC is a priority, as well as the major tools used (Jenkins, Ansible, etc.). Along the way, we should pick up the DevOps certification from AWS.

- HashiCorp Certified Terraform Associate
- AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional
- Jenkins: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/continuous-integration-with-jenkins
- TeamCity: https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/continuous-integration-with-teamcity
