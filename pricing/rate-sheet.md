## Notes on Rate Strategy

### Hourly Billing

- It's easy for us and clients to speak transparently about hours, so we bill by the hour.
- Hourly billing also enables clients to have greater transparency on the expected costs of various features, and to adjust priorities as necessary to optimize their value/cost.
- Hourly billing is about as _Agile_ as possible

### Fixed Rate

- It's easy for us and clients to work with one fixed rate, so we charge a single hourly rate for everything that we do.
- All of our consultants are excellent. Our clients tend to feel like they're getting a great deal on the value that we provide.
- We reserve the right to update our rate in the future to keep in line with market rates, but not without advance notice.
