Bamboo believes strongly in transparency and making it as easy as possible to start working on building quality software.

## Our Rate

### $120 per hour

## Notes on Rate Strategy

### Hourly Billing

- It's easy for us and clients to speak transparently about hours, so we bill by the hour.
- Hourly billing also enables clients to have greater transparency on the expected costs of various features, and to adjust priorities as necessary to optimize their value/cost.

### Fixed Rate

- It's easy for us and clients to work with one fixed rate, so we charge a single hourly rate for everything that we do.
- All of our consultants are excellent, so it makes sense for the same rate to apply to all.
- We reserve the right to update our rate in the future to keep in line with market rates, but not without advance notice, and not more than once per year (likely even less frequently than that).
