## Paid Time Off

Each employee is alotted a set of PTO days, which are meant to cover vacation, sick, and personal days.

Employees will never start with less than 20 PTO days, and various factors can increase this number over time.

All employees are strongly encouraged to use all of their days. We need rest and rejuvenation! To further encourage this, a maximum of 5 PTO days may be carried forward to the next year.

## Family Leave

We want to see our family grow. Reach out to Michael directly to determine a generous leave plan for the birth of new children that works for everybody. We're flexible here.

## Bereavement Leave

Supporting loved ones is one of the most sacred things we can do. If somebody you care about passes away and you need to take time off to attend services or grieve, let Michael know and we'll work something out.
