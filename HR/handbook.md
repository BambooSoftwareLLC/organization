# Handbook

## Core Values

- Integrity: We're honest with our clients, our colleagues, and ourselves. We do the right thing because it's the right thing. Our clients can trust us.
- Quality: We don't settle for mediocre. Quality doesn't mean over-engineered. Heavily emphasizing education is how we maintain quality.
- Family: We work so that we can have and support our families. We are not a family. We love working together, and we love leaving each other every day to spend time with our actual families.

## Internal Stuff

### Office Life

We are a fully remote company (so far), with roots in NE Ohio. In the future, we might get an office space or rent a coworking space, if the need is there.

#### One on One Meetings

Especially early on, it’s important to have clear and open communication as we get used to each other. If there are any concerns that crop up, we need to address them early and openly (kill the dragon when it’s little).

Initially, they should be weekly. Ideally in person, but video meeting is possible if necessary.

The goal of these meetings is to check in on how things are going generally. If there are technical challenges, they can be brought up as well, but the emphasis should be on building a relationship and ensuring Bamboo and its systems are adequate to support your work.

#### Daily Summaries

These should be roughly 3-5 bullet points or sentences (or a short Loom video) that describe “WHAT” happened during the day. What did you work on? Were there any highlights? Are you blocked by anything? These summaries are like a condensed Daily Scrum meeting.

#### Daily Standups

These meetings will ideally last for 10-15 mins.  We will use this time to do the following:
1. Recaps: Go over recaps from previous day to keep everyone up to date on the status of projects
2. Next Steps: Make sure each team member has 2 or 3 options of what they can work on and accomplish that day
3. Blocking Points:  If there are roadblocks, concerns or questions about how to accomplish options in #2, they can be addressed here
4. Learning Review:  This will be a touch base on what has been recently learned in Pluralsight, yesterday's work etc...

#### Dress Code

We’re a tech company, but also a professional organization. We should present ourselves to our clients (and their clients!) as professionals. This coincides with our policy of preferring keeping video on during video meetings with clients (unless you’re the only odd duck with his video still on).

There’s no hard rules about what this means. You were hired by Bamboo because you have good judgment, so listen to your inner voice and all should be well.

For reference, I try to make myself wear a shirt with a collar everyday, even if it’s just a polo (summer) or flannel (winter), but occasionally I might wear a tasteful t-shirt if I don’t expect much client interaction.

#### PTO Requests

PTO shouldn’t be a pain to request. At the same time, we’re servicing clients who have their own expectations. To that end, just try to give as much notice as possible when requesting days off, and there shouldn’t be any issues.

It’s strongly encouraged to take at least one vacation during the year of 5 consecutive days to help deeply reset the mind. More in a row would be fine, too, assuming clients can be alerted well in advance, or covered.

#### Team Lunches

Food is very important for building group unity and solidarity. I leave it to the team to work out how often we eat team lunches (within reason), and where. My goal would be at least bi-monthly, but weekly seems feasible, as well.

#### (Eventually (maybe)) Coworking Days

100% remote work isn’t healthy for the human soul, so Bamboo will be exploring options for part-time “work-togethers”. We could meet at a middle-ground coworking space, or look into leasing a more permanent space.

Let’s figure out the other stuff first, but be vocal about this if it feels like it becomes a need to get out of the house more regularly.

### Education

Constant and continuous education is a defining feature of Bamboo. We need to be experts for our clients, and that’s only possible if we have expertise, which is gained through a combination of doing and learning.

Spending time on education is an investment for the future. It reduces billable hours immediately, but it leads to higher rates, more clients, better clients, and more company and personal stability.

Early on, employees will be required to devote a significant amount of time to education per week. At the very early stages, it could be as much as 10-15 hours, leaving only 25-30 hours for billing clients. As experience increases, the workday requirement will lessen.

#### Language & Framework Foundations

The wise man built his house upon a rock. We need solid foundations before learning advanced topics.

As a primarily .NET shop, the initial foundation should be composed of C#/.NET. Bamboo Software Consultants should be poets with the C# language.

#### Cloud & DevOps

Our clients rely on us mostly as cloud experts, so this is the next important area to cover. That said, we can be productive with simply a solid .NET foundation and a general (not deep) understanding of the cloud. Hence, this stage is meant to introduce Software Consultants to the cloud so that they can be productive for clients. Later stages will dive in more deeply.

Bamboo also focuses on implementing professional DevOps solutions for clients. So we hit this area lightly initially, as well.

We're also finalizing an industry/client targeted niche, and will adjust the educational plans to target this area, as well. Stay tuned!

#### Certifications

Obtaining official industry certifications is beneficial on at least two fronts. First, we learn a lot while going through the certification training. Second, being able to point to certifications helps to persuade current and future clients to trust us as experts.

As such, Bamboo will increasingly encourage the pursuit of a select list of industry certifications as employees mature beyond the foundational stages. To the employees themselves, obtaining certifications have multiple benefits:
1. More knowledge, which is always great for your personal career
2. Bamboo covers the cost of exams and study materials
3. Bamboo pays a reward for successful completions of certifications (to be defined soon)

#### Other Stuff

Other areas that need to be covered, over time, include:
- Web development
- Advanced architecture
- Advanced DevOps
- Advanced industry/niche knowledge
- Best practices
- More languages

Some of these additional topics will still be pursued individually, while others will be encouraged and hosted internally via:
- Paid training courses
- Team “movie” hours (where we all watch the same video and talk about it)
- Conference attendance
- Team library / book clubs

### Career Paths

#### Software Consultant

This is the level at which most will start. The work is the meat and potatoes of Bamboo. Software Consultants should always be developing expertise to better serve clients.

There is a lot of room to grow in this role, as the pay band is very wide and bonus potential is as big as our profits are. For those who just want to be great software developers, delivering value to clients in the form of code and related matters, this role offers ways to grow vertically from an economic and expertise perspective, and horizontally from a breadth of knowledge perspective.

#### Business Development (the "rain maker")

We need to feed the beast. To make money, Bamboo needs to make sales to new clients. Business development is focused on this. We won’t have anybody dedicated to this role until/unless we grow large enough for it to make sense.

The way to grow in this role is by making more sales and enlisting more clients into your portfolio that you manage. Bonus potential is linked to client profitability.

#### Partner

Architects, lawyers, doctors, accountants… professional occupations tend to organize their agencies as partnerships. I think it makes sense for software, as well. This is the highest level that Software Consultants can reach, and we don’t have details about how it would look at this point, but this is where we can aspire to.

Partners need to be deep experts technically, and also show proven ability and desire to grow the business through sales, networking, mentoring, and hiring. Attaining partnership takes years of dedication to the business and one’s personal development, but the reward is real ownership in the company and a fancy title on your business card.

## External Stuff

### Client Work

When working with clients, it’s especially important to remember our core values as a company:
- Integrity
- Quality
- Family

As well as the values that we seek from our employees:
- Integrity
- Intelligence
- Independence

#### Efficiently solve problems

Our clients enjoy working with us because we efficiently solve their problems. They can always hire developers for less than our rate, which means that we need to offset the higher cost with even greater value.

Moreover, our integrity dictates that we avoid solutions that are inefficient and that will cost our clients more than they would pay for otherwise great solutions that are more efficiently implemented. If a client requests something that may take 10 hours, but we know there are potentially acceptable alternatives that would take 1 hour, we as the experts with integrity should explain the situation to our clients so that they can make informed decisions.

#### Clear Communication

We work remotely, so clients don’t see what we’re doing at all times. But they want to know. They have concerns about finishing projects on time and with great quality, and they may worry if we can deliver for them, and deliver affordably. To ease their worries, we should be over-communicators (frequency, not depth) about our progress.

We should prioritize all forms of documentation to make it clear what we have developed, how we developed it, and how we or others can easily maintain it in the future. Our integrity requires that we document it so well that our clients would feel comfortable using another agency to continue the work, not worried about losing our unique knowledge of the system.

#### Careful Coding

Our clients count on us to do great work and to build systems that they can count on to be secure, reliable, and easy to maintain. This means that we need to be extra careful when coding solutions for them. Write tests, and make sure they’re easy to read/maintain. Test in multiple environments. Write documentation that helps us and others test independently. Don’t cut corners on security. Ask others to review security concerns. Etc.

### (Eventually) Conferences

Conferences are fun and full of cutting edge stuff. Eventually, we need to take advantage of them within reason.

#### To Learn

We can learn new things and stay near the leading edge of innovation and best practices.

#### To Teach

As experts, we should be leading the conversation on the topics that we specialize in. This is good for the business, building our brand, and good for the team members that get to speak, building their personal brands and speaking skills.

#### To Recruit

When we’re ready to recruit more future Bamboo Software Consultants, we could network and find potential candidates at conferences.
