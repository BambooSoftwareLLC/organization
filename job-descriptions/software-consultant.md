# Software Consultant

A **Software Consultant** is much more than just a great developer. He or she is able to manage an entire software project from start to finish, guided only by the client's priorities and vision. This is essential to enable Bamboo to offer a uniquely _ultra-lean_ software development experience without the bloat of project managers, QAs, scrum leaders, DevOps engineers, coffee fetchers, etc.

What hats does the **Software Consultant** wear?
- Software architect
- Back-end developer
- Front-end developer
- UI connoisseur
- Project manager
- QA tester
- DevOps engineer

In order to succeed while wearing so many hats, we must minimize the complexities that we can:
- Simplify communications
- Simplify DevOps and architectures
- Use already existing best practices instead of inventing new ones - the "adopted bleeding edge"

A successful **Software Consultant** at Bamboo will enjoy:
- Communicating with clients
- Pushing back against clients in order to provide them the most value (aka, **_reducing_** the amount that they pay us)
- Architecting systems
- Building the nuts and bolts of systems
- Building efficient back-end systems with an emphasis on writing code that's maintainable
- Building attractive front-end systems with an emphasis on clean design and providing a "standard and expected" user experience
- Writing clear automated tests
- Building DevOps pipelines that are a joy to use as the developer
- Working in small chunks over short timelines (1-3 days)
- Collecting cloud knowledge and certifications
- Collecting industry-specific knowledge and certifications

In addition, a successful **Software Consultant** at Bamboo will be able to:
- Understand and be aware of the business perspectives of our clients
- Work independently and/or on a team of 2 (like all the cool "cops partners" movies)
- Collaborate and share best practices (sharing means _offering_ and _using_)
- Write high quality software in a number of popular languages and frameworks, with an emphasis on C# / .NET
- Build web applications that are attractive and follow standard design and UX patterns

There's no rule on how many years of experience a **Software Consultant** should have. Rather, the **Software Consultant** is the face of Bamboo to the clients he or she is working with, so they must be able to provide a highly professional level of service.

A rough idea of some skills that are important:
- Ability to quickly spin up and deploy an API with: authentication/authorization, logging, database connectivity, automated tests, docker container, etc.
- Ability to quickly spin up and deploy a web application with: authentication/authorization, logging, API connectivity, automated tests, state management, responsive design, etc.
- Ability to architect an abstract system with as much simplicity as reasonable
- Very clear written communication skills
- Very clear coding style
- Pleasant and professional voice/video communication skills
- Ability to build simple devops pipelines and familiarity with at least one major automated build tool

Must-haves:
- C# / .NET

Nice-to-haves:
- Cloud certifications
- Industry certifications (to be defined)
- JavaScript + TypeScript + React/Vue/Angular + Node
- Tailwind CSS (Bootstrap is okay)
